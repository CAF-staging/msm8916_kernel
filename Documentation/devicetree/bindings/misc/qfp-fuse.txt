* QFP-FUSE

The qfp-fuse entry specifies the memory mapped addresses for the QFPROM fuse
registers. The qfpfuse driver uses these to provide api(s) that can be used
to read and write the fuse values. The write operation can be done one time
only.

Required Properties:
compatible: component name used for driver matching, should be "qcom,qfp-fuse"
reg: physical base address and length of the register set
qcom,blow-status-offset: offset of the blow status registers.
vdd-blow-supply: regulator used to blow fuses. For backward compatibility, the
regulator name must contain the string vdd-blow.

Example:
	qcom,qfpfuse@fc4b8000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qfp-fuse";
		reg = <0xfc4b8000 0x7000>;
		qcom,blow-status-offset = 0x204c;
		vdd-blow-supply: <&vdd_blow>;
	};
